Step 1: Install Vagrant with Homebrew
Run Command 

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew install gcc
brew install vagrant 
brew install virtualbox
brew install virtualbox-extension-pack
brew install vagrant-completion
vagrant box add hashicorp/bionic64
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-desktop
```

Then, you must enable WSL 2 support. To do that, append two lines into the ~/.zshrcfile:

The terminal on WSL 2
# append those two lines into ~/.zshrc

```sh 
echo 'export VAGRANT_WSL_ENABLE_WINDOWS_ACCESS="1"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/mnt/c/Program Files/Oracle/VirtualBox"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

# now reload the ~/.zshrc file

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

 Installing the vmware-desktop plugin

```sh
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-desktop
```

Create Ubuntu Virtual Machine

Ensure ``Vagrantfile`` is in your present working directory:

```sh
vagrant up 
```

Step 7. Now we will SSH into the VM and see if we can get an ip address to show. 

```sh
vagrant ssh
```
